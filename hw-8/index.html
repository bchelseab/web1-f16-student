	<h2> Goals </h2>
    <p> Like most aspiring designers, an easily accesible online portfolio is something that I really do need. In the years I've spent here at MassArt, I've created a huge body of work, and yet I have no way to show off my progress. All of my art either lives physically collecting dust in a drawer, or sits as a neglected digital file on my hard drive. If I had an active portfolio, I could give my best work a real platform. That way, if there were ever an opportunity to get a job in my field, I'd be able to demonstrate my abilities and skills in one centralized site. 
    <br />
    I want my site to be a little more quirky and unconventional than your typical polished portfolio website. Obviously, it has to be professional and showcase my work in a flattering light, but I want it to show my personality a little bit, too.</p>
