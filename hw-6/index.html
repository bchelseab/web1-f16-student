		<h2>Event Page Use Cases</h2>
			<ul>
            	<li>Determine location of the Summit</li>
                <li>Find ticket prices</li>
                <li>Find contact info</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps to find contact info</h2>
        	<ol>
            	<li>Activate Voiceover by pressing command+f5</li>
                <li>CTRL+option+shift+↓ to begin interacting with the page</li>
                <li>CTRL+option+A to prompt Voiceover to begin reading the entire page</li>
                <li>CTRL+option+→ pressed repeatedly to skip through each section once it became clear that the info I needed was not there</li>
                <li>Once I reached the end of the page without hitting contact info, I used CTRL+option+← to return to the last section, the footer</li>
                <li>CTRL+option+A to begin reading the footer. The first item read was "Contact: inquiries@spaghettisummit2016.com"
            </ol>
        <h2>Improving HTML</h2>
        	<ul>
            	<li>I felt that the largest issue was the fact that I had to listen through each section in order to find out what information it contained. In the footer, where the contact info is located, I'd have no way of knowing this unless I selected the footer to listen to</li>
                <li>To remedy this, I added a title property to the footer, defining it as "contact info"</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Try 2</h2>
        	<ol>
            	<li>Activate Voiceover by pressing command+f5</li>
                <li>CTRL+option+shift+↓ to begin interacting with the page</li>
                <li>CTRL+option+A to prompt Voiceover to begin reading the entire page</li>
                <li>CTRL+option+→ , this time pressed quickly as I skipped each section as soon as I heard its title</li>
                <li>Finally, Voiceover told me I had reached "Footer contact info"</li>
                <li>Knowing this is where my answer would be located, I hit CTRL+option+A to read the section</li>
            </ol>
            </div>
