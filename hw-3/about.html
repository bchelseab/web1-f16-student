    <h2>About Karen Borg</h2>
    <p>In 1979 I went to Pratt Institute to study painting. In my senior year a friend suggested that I take a pottery class with her. I loved it! That was the end of my painting career, and the beginning of what I am still doing today. There was something about the fact that when I created something in pottery, I could use it in everyday life.
    <br />
After graduation from Pratt with a BFA, I apprenticed with potter Judy O’Donahue, who was part of the Brooklyn Potters Group. There I was exposed to such greats as Byron Temple and Ragnar Naess. During this time I also worked in SoHo for the painter Howard Buchwald, and then for the sculptor Alice Aycock. While working in the SoHo world of galleries, dealers and dollars I felt eclipsed; whereas with my time spent in the potter’s world, I felt joy, inspiration and creative energy. Today this still carries me to each new exciting discovery of shape, texture, color, and material.
<br />
The practicality that gave me joy in making usable pots also drove me to enter the Masters program at New York Institute of Technology in the brand-new field of computer graphics (Macs were not yet invented!). Throughout that period I continued my apprenticeship to the potter. By the time I graduated, I was working full time in computer graphics, had stopped apprenticing pottery, and had started taking advanced pottery classes in studios in NYC and NJ.
<br />
One of the studios where I studied was the Old Church Cultural Center in Demarest, NJ. My teacher there was Mikhail Zakin, a peer of Karen Karnes. Learning from her showed me that time, life and my contemporaries were the best fertilizers of the craft. I settled in for the long patient journey.
I got married and moved several times, from NY to MA to CA to CT and back to MA. During that time my husband and I had 2 babies. I was a full- time mom and continued to pay for pottery classes in studios and art centers, fitting in hours as I could. Because of all the different studios I worked in over the years, I was exposed to many types of clay, glazes, firing methods and temperatures. Flexibility and countless ideas became a valuable part of the working process.
<br />
Several years later, with my family settled in Acton, Massachusetts, and with the babies in elementary school, I finally set up my own studio and pottery business, Cave Made Pottery. I start each pot remembering the instructions from my first pottery teacher at Pratt (Nancy LaPointe- UMass Amherst): each step is equally important and must be mastered to proceed with success, from wedging to cooling. It is with great joy that I go out there on school days and work with the rhythms, feelings and spirits that move me, until the kids get home.
