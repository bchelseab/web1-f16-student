<h2>Client Interview</h2>
	<blockquote>
   <b> Why do you want a website?</b>
Because i feel like it’s crucial to not only advertise my brand locally, but also reach a nationwide market.
<br />

<b>What does your business do?</b>
My foodtruck gives people the option of having breakfast at any time of day, wherever they are. 
My truck puts a unique spin on the usual breakfast staples.
<br />
<b>What are the requirements for your site?</b>
Obviously, the full menu. Social media links, pictures of the items to show customers not only how tasty the food looks, but how well we present it. Our daily location. Some contact info. That’s it.
<br />
<b>What general “look” are you going for?</b>
Fun, unique, delicious.
