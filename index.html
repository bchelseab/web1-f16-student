		<h2>Examples of web design I'm into:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://mylapka.com/">mylapka.com</a>- with a beautifully minimal full-screen design, this site grabs my interest even though I have no idea what they're selling.</li>
			<li><a href="http://subtlepatterns.com/">subtlepatterns.com</a>- this site is easy to navigate and provides all the tools you need to utilize their lovely background patterns within each post.</li>
			<li><a href="http://mattroeser.com/">mattroeser.com</a>- a clean, simple site that shows off the designer's beautiful book covers without getting in the way.</li>
			<li><a href="http://builtbybuffalo.com/">builtbybuffalo.com</a>- by utilizing uncommon shapes (octogons, circles) as a base for their design, and integrating infographics throughout the page, this site really stands out.</li>
			<li><a href="http://thisissand.com/">thisissand.com</a>- a really fun, interactive flash site that allows you to create art with virtual sand.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Why am I taking this class?</h2>
		I've always had a strong interest in web design as part of my overarching interest in all thing GD. Since the summer web design class I took in 5th grade, I've enjoyed a limited (but gradually expanding) knowledge of html and css. Rarely has my knowledge been put to use outside of customizing tumblr themes, and I'd like to gain the skills I need to really build a site from the ground up. There's so much I don't yet know, especially in the realm of javascript, and I'm really excited to learn.
